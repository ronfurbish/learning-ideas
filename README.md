# Learning Ideas

A repo to for others and myself to brainstorm ideas for other projects to help folks learn new technology. Please contribute so I create useful projects :-)

## Rules for Editing Ideas

All ideas are welcome!  The list below is not a priority order, but rather just a list to generate ideas.  Nothing should be removed unless you are removing your own idea.  Once something is completed from the list we'll just use a ~~strike through~~ and move it to the [Completed Ideas](https://github.com/ronfurbish/learning-ideas/edit/main/README.md#completed-ideas) section.
